# verihat

> Manually minting ERC721 (NFT) of different brands on Mumbai (testnet)

```
git clone https://github.com/abhishekcrdsa7/blockchain-project.git
```

```
cd verihat
```

```
yarn install
```

```
yarn generate
```

ðŸ™Ž This will create a new mnemonic and you can get this **deployer** address using the command:

```
yarn account
```

Go to https://faucet.matic.network to get some Mumbai-MATIC (testnet currency).

> Compile and deploy your NFT contract:

```
yarn deploy
```

Start the frontend with:

```
yarn start
```

ðŸ“± Open http://localhost:3000 to see the app

---

### Minting:

> Edit the mint script mint.js in packages/hardhat/scripts and update the `toAddress` to your frontend address (wallet address in the top right or localhost:3000).

> in a new terminal window run the mint script:
```
cd verihat
yarn mint
```

You should see your brand NFT show up on the frontend if you minted to the correct address.

Now you will be able to send the NFTs to any ethererum address from front end.
